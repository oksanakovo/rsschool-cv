## **About me**
### I am 24 years old and live in Belarus, Minsk. The main factors influencing the life of my life are doing my job to my liking and becoming a cool expert. I believe that some of them can sit, diligence and diligence to the point of perfectionism. I am just starting to search in the world of programming and study this topic. Back in the letter, I wrote to start working at the university and become a programmer, but this profession was not available with low marks in algometry and English. It seemed to me that it was impossible to gain knowledge without a university, because at that time courses were not as common as they are now. I am happy that today I can fulfill my dream and study those topics that really interest me and make my heart beat faster. 
## ** Education
### Higher education - Belarusian State University (geographical faculty), Minsk. Passed courses on sales, targeted advertising and mobile editing.
## **English level**
### My English level is A1 and I'm ready to improve it! Now there is an incentive to seriously study English for better and faster programming.
